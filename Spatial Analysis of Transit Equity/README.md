# All Aboard: Navigating Public Transit Access in Chicago

A spatial analysis examining transit equity and accessibility gaps across Chicago's neighborhoods using ArcGIS Story Maps and geospatial analysis techniques.

## Project Overview

Public transportation is essential for economic opportunity, mobility, and equity. This project explores how Chicago's CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) train access is distributed across the city, revealing significant disparities between neighborhoods and their connection to opportunity.

## Research Questions

- How is CTA train access distributed across Chicago neighborhoods?
- Which communities face limited transit service ("transit deserts")?
- How does transit access correlate with demographic factors like income and race?
- What strategies can promote more equitable transit development?

## Key Findings

### Transit Distribution Patterns
- Transit services are concentrated in the **North Side and downtown** areas
- Wealthier neighborhoods have higher frequency and more route options
- **South and West Sides** show significant gaps in coverage

### Transit Deserts
- Identified neighborhoods with few or no nearby CTA stops
- These areas often overlap with **low-income and minority communities**
- Limited mobility restricts access to work, education, and healthcare opportunities

### Equity Gaps
- Service quality aligns strongly with wealthier, central areas
- Persistent disparities in low-income neighborhoods
- Data reveals hidden patterns that impact daily life for thousands of residents

## Tools & Technologies

- **ArcGIS Story Maps** - Interactive spatial storytelling
- **ArcGIS Pro** - Spatial analysis and mapping
- **ArcGIS Online** - Web-based visualization

### GIS Techniques Applied
- Spatial joins
- Buffer analysis (proximity to transit stops)
- Symbology and cartographic design
- Demographic overlay analysis

## Data Sources

- **CTA Data:** Train routes, stops, and service areas
- **U.S. Census Bureau:** Demographics (income, population density, race/ethnicity)
- **Chicago Open Data Portal:** Neighborhood boundaries

## Recommendations

Based on the spatial analysis, this project recommends:

1. **Expand transit services** to underserved South and West Side communities
2. **Prioritize funding** for infrastructure in transit deserts
3. **Involve residents** in planning and decision-making processes
4. **Use data-driven maps** to guide future transit investments and policy

## Impact

> "Equity in transportation = equity in opportunity"

This analysis demonstrates how GIS tools can:
- Reveal spatial inequalities that affect daily life
- Bridge data analysis with compelling storytelling
- Inform evidence-based urban planning decisions
- Advocate for more equitable resource allocation

## Skills Demonstrated

- Spatial data analysis and GIS modeling
- Buffer and proximity analysis
- Demographic overlay analysis
- Data visualization and cartography
- Interactive web mapping
- Spatial storytelling with Story Maps
- Urban planning and equity analysis
