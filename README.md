# Geospatial Health Analytics Projects

Projects from Carnegie Mellon University's Geospatial Health Analytics course (Spring 2025).

## About

This course focused on applying GIS techniques to health-related problems and spatial analysis. I learned to create interactive dashboards, story maps, and conduct spatial analyses to examine health equity, accessibility, and social determinants of health.
