# Transportation to Work Dashboard

An interactive ArcGIS Dashboard analyzing commuting patterns, transportation modes, and essential worker distributions across Pittsburgh-area municipalities and neighborhoods.

## Project Overview

Work environments have changed drastically in recent years, with organizations adopting hybrid work models and flexible workplace arrangements. This dashboard explores transportation patterns and commute times to help decision-makers identify where infrastructure improvements are needed based on worker locations.

## Key Metrics

The dashboard tracks five primary transportation modes:

- **Car, Truck, or Van:** 484k workers
- **Public Transportation:** 54k workers
- **Bicycle, Motorcycle, Taxi:** 17k workers
- **Walk:** 24k workers
- **Work at Home:** 54k workers

## Features & Visualizations

### Interactive Map
- Spatial distribution of workers across the Pittsburgh region
- Color-coded neighborhoods showing worker concentration
- Geographic patterns of commuting behaviors

### Workers by Commute Time
- Bar chart comparing commute duration across municipalities
- Yellow bars: total workers
- Red bars: percentage breakdown by location
- Identifies areas with longer vs. shorter commutes

### Municipality Rankings
- Total workers by municipality and neighborhood
- Top locations include:
  - Penn Hills: 20,546 workers
  - Bethel Park: 16,795 workers
  - Ross: 16,071 workers
  - Mount Lebanon: 15,887 workers

### Essential Workers Analysis
- Includes healthcare, protective services, food handlers, and transportation workers
- HealthyWorkContour layer shows health risk concentration areas
- Kernel density analysis for spatial patterns

## Data Sources

- **U.S. Census Bureau:** American Community Survey (ACS) data
- **Time Period:** 2016-2020 aggregated by block group
- **Geographic Level:** County municipalities and city neighborhoods
- **Average US Commute Time:** 26 minutes (benchmark)

## Tools & Technologies

- **ArcGIS Dashboards** - Interactive dashboard creation
- **ArcGIS Online** - Web mapping and data hosting
- **GIS Analysis:** Kernel density analysis for health variables
- **Data Sources:** Esri, CGIAR, USGS, data.pa.gov, TomTom, Garmin, SafeGraph, FAO, METI/NASA, EPA, NPS, USFWS

## Key Insights

1. **Private vehicle dominance:** 484k workers rely on cars, trucks, or vans
2. **Work-from-home shift:** 54k workers now work remotely, equal to public transit users
3. **Public transit usage:** 54k workers depend on public transportation
4. **Active transportation:** Combined walking and biking represents 41k commuters
5. **Geographic patterns:** Worker concentration varies significantly by municipality

## Applications

This analysis supports:
- **Transportation planning:** Identify where transit infrastructure is needed
- **Workplace location decisions:** Understand worker distribution patterns
- **Essential worker support:** Target resources to high-density areas
- **Health equity:** Correlate commuting patterns with health outcomes
- **Policy development:** Data-driven decisions for transportation investments


## Skills Demonstrated
